/**
   * This is a recursive function used to retrieve the includes of the queries.
   * What we try to do is to not enable recursive calls. For example:
   *
   * If we have a model user and this model user refers to itself we will not be able to retrieve the relations.
   * for this relation with itself. The same apply for other models.
   *
   * Usually a relation is tied Both ways, this means that, if we have the model User and Post.
   * and we attach each user to a post. Then from the User we will be able to retrieve all of the Posts
   * and from each Post we will be able to retrieve the attached user.
   *
   * Suppose that we are trying to retrieve the posts of the user. That's fine, but trying to retrieve the user from
   * each Post will lead to a circular relation which will lead to a recursion, this is not supported from Sequelize
   * so we do not support this here.
   *
   * About the explanation above: Each user will retrieve N posts, but each post will retrieve a user, but each user
   * will retrieve N posts,... That's what makes it recursive.
   *
   * @param model - The model we want to retrieve the associations from.
   * @param includes - The models that we are wanting to include.
   * @param includeStatement - An array. Remember that it's passed by reference so we can pass it over
   * inside of the recursion and it's reference will be updated.
   * @param modelAlreadyParsed - Those are the models that were already parsed, we need this so we can
   * prevent recursive/circular includes like we explained above.
   *
   * @returns - Returns an array, this array is the include statement to be used inside of the query.
