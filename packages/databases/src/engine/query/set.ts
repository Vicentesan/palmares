   * many small queries to the database, which might slow things down, but you will be guaranteed to work 100%
   * with the types.
   *
   * For a more performatic approach you should implement `queryDataNatively`. That will translate the query to the
   * native query, but the second can be harder to implement since it relies on knowing about palmares objects and
   * model structure.
   *
   * @param modelConstructor - The model instance to query.
   * @param search - The search argument to search on the database.
   * @param fields - The fields to be included in the search and the output.
