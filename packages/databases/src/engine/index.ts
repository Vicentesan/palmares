/**
 * Instead of creating our own ORM for the framework we wrap any orm we want to use inside of this class. This allow
 * our framework to have a consistent API for all ORMs that the user wants to use so he will not need to change much
 * of his code if he just wants to build a different orm.
 *
 * FOR ENGINE CREATORS:
 * 1 - Everything starts with the `new` constructor, first, this is how you will connect your engine to the database. Generally
 * most orms will create an instance of some class, save this on `instance`.
 *
 * 2- After that `initializeModel` will be called to translate the model to a instance of something that your engine can understand.
 * For that you should use the `EngineFields`. `EngineFields`, as explained in the class, is for translating each particular field
 * of the model to something that the orm can understand. This should return the model translated so we can use it. Don't forget to call
 * the base class with `super.initializeModel(model, theInstanceOfYourCustomModel)` so we can save it on the `initializedModels` object
 * in the class instance.
